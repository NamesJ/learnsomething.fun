                    <p>Jacob has been successfully helping me accomplish challenging projects in a very well organized, step-by-step, and detailed manner. He always explains the purpose of every line of code, and always ensures my repetitive questions are thoroughly answered. I’ve learned a tremendous amount on the logical application of different modules. He always finds creative and logical ways to overcome each programming challenge as they arise. In addition, he always quickly responds to my request for lessons. Overall, he’s been very skillful in helping me develop programs to automate manual tasks that I didn’t think was possible. Truly exceptional tutor, highly recommended!</p>

                    <p>We went through a Python coding assignment in which I was stuck with errors and I did not know what to do. Jacob is an incredible tutor, he has tons of knowledge since he figured out the errors in a very short time. Jacob was a Godsend, he explained very well, detailed, and clearly, and he is very patient. He is very easy to get along with. I am very happy that I found him. He is definitely a Gem and I highly recommend him!!</p>
